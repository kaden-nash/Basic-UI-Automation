The input will have the following specifications:

1. Any special keys will be recognized as they are found in Utility.h under virtualKeyMap.
2. Any strings you wish to simulate, wrap them in "" (double quotation marks)
3. Anything else will cause a crash
4. The delimiter will be a comma
5. If you want to enter key combinations, enter them all in within the same comma, separated by a pipe |.
   a. Since all compound commands require simulation of a key press and not just printing a character,
      only inputs that match keys on the virtualKeyMap will be valid. Otherwise, you'll get a crash.

Note: Compound commands cannot be performed with the mouse ... yet

Ex: Left Windows + searching for file explorer + pressing enter
lwin, "File explorer", lenter

Ex: Control + f to pull up a regex search
lctrl | f, "string I'm looking for"
